				<h2>GES, what is this?</h2>
					This is a Web application that allows managements for schools.

				<h2>Why creating an application like that?</h2>
					Current technology is well advanced, yet the management of the majority of schools and institutions in Madagascar leaves something to be desired. <br>
					This is the main reason why we decided to design an application that can help administrators of any school.


				<h2>Why using GES?</h2>
					The GES app is designed to be <strong> easy to use </strong>. At the same time, it is <strong> complete </strong>. <br>
					It has several <strong> features </strong> that are <strong> useful </strong> to any institution. <br>
					These features will allow, for example, to manage the payment of school fees made by students.
					or the follow-up of absences and delays of students as well as professors.
